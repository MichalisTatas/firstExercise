# firstExercise

done : 

- created hash tabl
- created avl tree
- sorted list of patients
- finished q

to do :

- finish binary max heap
- start question fullfiling prerequisits



UNDERSTANDING :: 

- diseaseHashTable : 

	has disease name for key
	
	for each separate disease in this ht we have a pointer to an avl tree which stores
	every patient with the same disease


- countryHashTable :

	has country name for key

	for each separate country every node holds a pointer to an avl tree which stores
	every patient taken health care in this country

** EVERY TREE HAS FOR KEY THE PATIENT'S ENTRYDATE**

for the trees make a function to locate if a tree already exists and return it to add more patients
maybe of return null
